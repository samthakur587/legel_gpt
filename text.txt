Adjudication Number:  ADJ2193346

OPINION AND ORDER 
DISMISSING PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
 Lien claimant Charles Schwarz, M.D., seeks reconsideration of the Findings of Fact 
Regarding Liens issued on September 1, 2021 by a workers’ compensation administrative law 
judge (WCJ). The WCJ found that lien claimant was required to file a declaration pursuant to 
Labor Code1 section 4903.05, but failed to do so, and thus, that lien claimant’s lien is invalid.   
 Lien claimant contends that he was not required to file a declaratio n pursuant to section 
4903.05 because the lien was filed in 2003 and was thus, never subject to a filing fee under section 4903.05, subdivision (c)(2). 
 Defendant filed an Answer to Petition for Reconsideration (Answer), and the WCJ filed a 
Report and Reco mmendation on Petition for Reconsideration (Report). The WCJ recommends that 
the Appeals Board denies the Petition for Reconsideration.  
 We have reviewed the record in this case, the allegations of the Petition for Reconsideration 
and the Answer, as well as the contents of the Report. Based on the reasons set forth below, we 
dismiss the Petition for Reconsideration.
